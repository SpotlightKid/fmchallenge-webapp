Possible Ways of Handling Voting Statistics / Trends:
-----------------------------------------------------

E = Everybody
U = Registered users
V = Voters
C = Competition entrants


1. No statistics or trends shown to anybody until voting is over

2a. C can see total score of each track (i.e. score board at that point in time)
2b. C can see total score of own track
2c. C can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)
2d. C can see how often own track has been voted for (but not points per vote)

3a. V can see total score of each track
3b. V can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)

4a. U can see total score of each track
4b. U can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)

5a. E can see total score of each track
5b. E can see how often each track has been voted for (but not points per vote)
